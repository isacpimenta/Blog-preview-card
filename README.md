## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox 
- SVG
- External Text Fonts
- External CSS file

### What I learned

In general, I didn't have much difficulty with this challenge. However, one point to highlight is that I learned to attach the page footer to the end of the page.

Follow the example below:
```html
<footer class="attribution">
  Challenge by <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io?ref=challenge" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor</a>.  
  Coded by <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/isacpimenta">Isac Pimenta</a>.
</footer>
```
```css
footer{
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
}
```

### Continued development

Currently I intend to focus on page responsiveness, and start learning Javascript

### Useful resources
